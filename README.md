## 1.1. Purpose
**What is this App about?**

This app offers food lovers a platform to order healthy, authentic home-cooked food prepared by people who genuinely care about cooking. It allows people to buy fresh home-cooked food prepared by professional or hobbyist cooks using the best ingredients. It also provides users to choose from a variety of cuisines and home chefs.

**What are the available choices and what’s wrong with them?**

There are currently three options for people to eat: prepare at home, eat at a restaurant, or order takeaway.

Although cooking food at home seems like the best approach, it may not be suitable for everyone, as people may be busy with their work or other responsibilities. So people tend to go with the other two options. The problem with this is that not all restaurants maintain basic quality standards. We are unknown about the quality of food when we order online through apps. This is deteriorating our health and causing different diseases. Food ordered through takeaway delivery is expensive.

**How are we solving this problem?**

We are introducing the fourth way of ordering food i.e ordering home-cooked food from local people and local chefs made at their home. Our dream is to offer home-cooked high-quality food to everyone who loves fresh and nutritious meals but has no time, skill, or resources to prepare one for themselves. You can finally order healthy and authentic home-cooked food prepared by people who are passionate about cooking with our app. Not only is our food healthy and tasty but it is also cheaper compared to restaurants and takeaways, as our chefs don’t need to pay the rent for the restaurant and are preparing food from the comfort of their home.

**How does it work?**

1. Browse through the list of delicious homemade dishes, prepared by our talented home cooks.
2. Choose a home-cooked meal and put an order.
3. Pick up your meal and enjoy fresh, homemade food, and share your experience with us!

The project will be developed using agile methodology. There are total four sprints planned, each of them being one week in duration. The first sprint is dedicated to inception, planning, and documentation. Remaining three sprints are dedicated to build in that one by one all the planned features of the project will be developed and deployed.
